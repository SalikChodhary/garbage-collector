# garbage-collector
My attempt at making a simple garbage collector for C. This garbage collector follows the mark and sweep algorithm, and works perfectly! 

The GC was supposed to be made for a C program, but instead is made for this very-mini (very very small subset of C) language built in the program itself. The language is dynamically typed and has two types ints and pairs. Can be extended to more types.

For tesing purposes, add tests to main and don't forget to free the VM, at the end of every test!
